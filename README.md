# Open mSupply Forecasting plugins

Contains a suite of "forecasting" plugins for Open mSupply:

## Back-end

- `transform_request_requisition_lines`:
  - On insert of new requisition_lines, it calculates a "Forecast quantity" for each line. The formula/logic for calculating this is detailed [in this issue](https://github.com/msupply-foundation/open-msupply/issues/7371).
  - this new value is s saved to "plugin_data" so it can be fetched as a new "column" by the front-end plugin
  - the existing field "suggested_quantity" is also modified -- the value stored in it is the new "forecast_quantity" minus the current stock on hand. This  modified value will be displayed by the normal detail view in the front-end.

## Front-end

- `ForecastQuantity`: inserts a new column on the Internal Orders "Detail" view: "Forecast amount", which is displayed to the right of "Suggested Quantity" and displayed the forecast value calculated above (and fetched from the "plugin_data" associated with a requisition_line record).
